            New Life Research Foundation is a Vision that came in 2013 during
            the protracted 6-month Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU)
            strike. The Visioner (Joseph Luper Tsenum) spent the six-month
            strike seeking the Lord to discover his purpose for living. It was
            then that he read a book written by Bro. Gbile Akanni titled ‘The
            Journey into Your Vision’. This brought insight to him and the
            subsequent vision to form New Life Research to mobilize God’s
            children into different nations for revival using academics,
            research, and scholarships. It is worthy of note that this name New
            Life Research was received in 2013 as well. <br />
            <br />
            New Life Research Foundation is for those who have this new life in
            Christ whom the Lord will be using in different nations for revival
            using academics and research. Jer. 1:1-19, 51:20-24 is the anchor
            scripture for New Life Research Foundation as the Lord promised to
            use anyone He wills to bring down revival in the nations. <br />
            <br />

            On October 23, 2017, the Lord came again speaking to our brother on
            the need to start taking the ‘initiation step’ into the nations. He
            created a page on Facebook on that day and called few brethren
            together whom they prayed and started the work. While few people
            believed in the Vision, some did not believe in it from the onset
            (probably because it was a mustard seed and himself was not yet into
            the nations he spoke to them about). In the same 2017, few members
            he was working with got scholarships and traveled to Europe while he
            was still in Nigeria. <br />
            <br />

            After applying for a scholarship in Europe in 2018 and securing it
            in 2019, he traveled to Russia for his Masters program and by then,
            more people believed in the Vision (The mustard seed NELIREF). New
            Life Research Foundation was formally launched on November 22,
            2019<br />
            <br />
            The mustard seed ‘NELIREF’ was incorporated in Nigeria as a
            non-profit Christian Academic/Research organization on March 2, 2022
            and in Georgia, United States on May 17, 2023. New Life Research
            Foundation now has more than 15, 000 followers on social media
            platforms (including its partners). Under this time, 100s of NELIREF
            members secured scholarships in different nations and now set to
            start its Pioneer Research Cohort, Symposiums and Annual Conference.
            Both undergraduate and graduate scholarship applicants are mentored
            to become what God wants to use them in the nations to achieve.
            <br />
            <br />

            Together with her partners such as The United Pentecostal Church
            (UPCI), Adullam Calvary Mission, Makurdi Christian Youth Summit,
            Ngunan Addingi Mentorship Program, The Moscow Goodnews Church and
            other research labs in North America, NELIREF is dedicated to
            counseling and mentoring its members to become sharp arrows in God’s
            quiver in the nations.  <br />
            <br />

            Indeed, the Lord can use anything, the mustard seed NELIREF is set
            to becoming a big umbrella where both believers in Jesus and
            unbelievers can come to drink from the living water and discover
            their purpose for living. Our Vision, aims and objectives can be
            gotten on our banner for more elaboration. <br />
